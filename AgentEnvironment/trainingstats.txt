nonCollabTImePenalty -- penalised agents for time (baseline)
increasedREwardAndDIstace -- increrased reward (1.5 instead of 1) and crowding penalty 
RayLengthIncReewardCrowdPenalth -- decreased raylength, increased reward and penalty for crowding
1 - 0.0005
2 - 0.0010
3 - 0.00075 penalty

decreasedRayLength -- decreased raylength
RayLengthIncReewardCrowdReward -- decreased raylength, increased reward and reward for crowding
1 - 0.0005 --good outcomes, experimented with an increase in results 
2 - 0.0010 threshold 0.15f -- observed that it could be further improved with increase in raycast length
3 - same as 2, but with raylength of 40 -- could not capture obscure spots; perhaps further increase in crowding reward is needed as 0.0010 is quite high
4 - comparable performance with 2, threshold at 0.20f
5 - threshold 0.10f no attempt at getting the green blocks

RayLengthCrowdReward  -- decreased raylength, reward for spreading out
1 - reward is 1.0f, approaches targets but can be more direct.. perhaps a greater time penalty?
2 - time penalty doubled to -0.001f
